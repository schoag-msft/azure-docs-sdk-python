summary: 'Async flavor of the retry policy.


  The async retry policy in the pipeline can be configured directly, or tweaked on
  a per-call basis.'
constructor:
  syntax: 'AsyncRetryPolicy(**kwargs: Any)'
  parameters:
  - name: retry_total
    description: 'Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

      Default value is 10.'
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: retry_connect
    description: 'How many connection-related errors to retry on.

      These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,

      which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request. Default
      value is 3.'
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: retry_read
    description: 'How many times to retry on read errors.

      These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the

      request may have side-effects. Default value is 3.'

    - <xref:int>
  - name: retry_status
    description: How many times to retry on bad status codes. Default value is 3.

    description: 'A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try

      (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay).

      Retry policy will sleep for: *{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries}

      seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep

      for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is 0.8.'

    - <xref:float>
  - name: retry_backoff_max
    description: The maximum back off time. Default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes).

  name: sleep
  summary: 'Sleep between retry attempts.


    This method will respect a server''s `Retry-After` response header

    and sleep the duration of the time requested. If that is not present, it

    will use an exponential backoff. By default, the backoff factor is 0 and

    this method will return immediately.'
